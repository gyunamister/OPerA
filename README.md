# Tool manual - DTWEEN

*Dtween* is an interactive tool implementing digital twins of organizations using action-oriented process mining. It provides a user-friendly interface, called digital twin interface model (DT-IM), from which users can define constraints and actions and compose action patterns. Based on the action pattern, it automates the execution of actions by analyzing business processes of the organization.

The control view of a DT-IM describes the routing/resource allocation rules of business processes, while specifying possible configurations over the information system supporting the process. The operational view of a DT-IM represents the current state of the process based on the marking of object-centric Petri nets and various diagnostics computed using event data from the system.

By communicating with a DT-IM, users can define action patterns which define a condition describing an undesired situation and an action to resolve the situation. *Dtween* monitors the action patterns by analyzing streaming event data and produces necessary actions.

## Deployment

### Manual

Please make sure to install the binaries of [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) and [Python 3.8.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/) before you proceed. In the following, shell scripts are developed for the zsh, so if you use a different shell, then you need to modify the scripts accordingly.

In the first shell:

```bash
pip install dtween
cd src/backend/db
docker-compose up
```

In the second shell:

```bash
export DTWEEN_PATH=<path_to_your_project_root> # the directory where src/ is located
cd src/backend
chmod +x ./run_celery.sh
./run_celery.sh
```

Alternatives to Windows:

```bash
pip install eventlet  
set REDIS_LOCALHOST_OR_DOCKER=localhost
set RABBIT_LOCALHOST_OR_DOCKER=localhost
set RABBITMQ_USER=dtween
set RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=dtween92! 
cd src/server/backend/tasks
celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=INFO -P eventlet
```

In the third shell:

```bash
export DTWEEN_PATH=<path_to_your_project_root> # the directory where src/ is located
cd src/backend
chmod +x ./run_dtween.sh
./run_dtween.sh
```

The default username is admin, and the default password is test123 for logging into the system available at 127.0.0.1/8050.

### Automatic

TBD

## Artificial information system

To facilitate the test of the tool, we provide an experimental environment with an information system supporting an artificial order handling process.

### Description of the order handling process

Below is the process model describing the order handling process in OCPN formalism:

![resources/images/Untitled%209.png](resources/images/Untitled%209.png)

- 14 resources are available in total at any point in time, each of them being responsible for multiple activities in the process.
- Orders are randomly placed and the resources process the orders and the corresponding items and routes based on First-in-First-out rule.

### Simulating the process

- The simulation is implemented using [Simpy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), discrete simulation framework based on standard Python.
- While simulating the process, the information system generates event logs recording the execution of the process in OCEL format.
- How-to
    1. Set up simulations (optional)

        Default settings are provided. If you change the setting, edit *src/infosystem/input/settings.py.*

    2. Configure the information system

        Multiple valves are available in the provided information system. For instance, *sn-price* determines the minimum price of the orders that require the notification for payments. Moreover, *caw-price* determines the minimum quantities of the items requiring approvals for checking availability.

        A configuration should be provided as a JSON format file. An example configuration is available at *src/infosystem/input/config.json*.

    3. Run Simulations

    To run simulations, you need to specify a directory to store event streams and the directory of the configuration.

    ```bash
    cd src/infosystem/simulation
    python run.py -l "<path_to_store_event_stream>" -c "<path_to_system_configuration>"
    ```
